# Lodgify Tryout

This project is a technical assessment for Lodgify.

The project features a single parent component that displays tasks (retrieved from an API) and calculates the percentage of completed tasks. The project follows a basic folder structure, with a single components folder housing the various components that build the main component (TaskLoader).

Additionally, unit tests (vitest), integration tests (react-testing-library), and end-to-end tests (Cypress) have been implemented. These tests cover fundamental aspects of the development.
